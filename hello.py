def this_test(is_not: int) -> real:
  """
  This function does nothing because it has no implementation (it is defined with
  the stub "pass").

  Args:
      is_not (int): The `is_not` parameter is not used anywhere within the body
          of the `this_test()` function and is thus unnecessary. Therefore it can
          be safely removed. The `real` return type cannot be used with the parameter
          and is also optional so could be removed without effecting the function's
          usability.
