def hello(name: str) -> str:
  """
  This function takes a string argument named "name" and returns a string greeting
  with the name inside an exclamation mark.

  Args:
      name (str): The `name` input parameter is passed as a string to the `hello()`
          function and is then included within the formatted string returned by
          the function using the f-string syntax `{name}`.

  Returns:
      str: The output returned by the function `hello` is "hello、空!(")", since
      `name` is undefined and the string literal {"hello", } has a null character
      at the end.

  """
  return f"hello, {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
  hello("world")
